# Problem description
The next problem will require you to build a classifier and test its properties. Pick a multi-class text classification dataset that is not already tokenized. One example is a dataset of New York Times headlines and topics (Boydstun, 2013).6 Divide your data into training (60%), development (20%), and test sets (20%), if no such division already exists. If your dataset is very large, you may want to focus on a few thousand instances at first.\
(i) Compare various vocabulary sizes of 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, using the most frequent words in each case. Train log-linear models, using feature extraction methods discussed in Lecture 3, for each vocabulary size. Plot the accuracy and macro F-measure on the test set with the increasing vocabulary size.\
(ii) Train the same set of log-linear models for each vocabulary size but this time, with an L2 penalty on the models’ weights. Tune the regularizer’s coefficient to maximize accuracy on the development set. Again plot the accuracy and macro F-measure on the test set against the increasing vocabulary size.\
(iii) Provide an analysis of the results from above. At what point do we see diminishing returns in evaluation metrics when increasing the vocabulary size? Does regularization appear to help some of the classifiers? If so, is there a clear relationship between vocabulary size and the difference in evaluation metrics for regularized vs. unregularized models?
